# python-template

![Python tests](https://github.com/Liamdoult/extreme-maths-py/workflows/Python%20tests/badge.svg)

A template project for quickly generating python project boilerplate code.

This is not a beginners project sturcture guide, for that see [pypa/sampleproject](https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject). This is more of a quick setup tool for starting projects according to my favourite best practices.

## Testing

All tests are written in with pytest. You can simply run the test suite with tox:

    $ tox
